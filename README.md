# Watchtower API for RewindBitcoin Wallet

## üìå Overview

The **Watchtower API** is a security monitoring service for the
**RewindBitcoin Wallet** that protects users' Bitcoin vaults from unauthorized
access. It continuously watches the blockchain for specific transactions that
would indicate someone is attempting to unfreeze a vault. When such activity is
detected, the service immediately sends **system-level push notifications** to the user's
iOS and Android devices where the RewindBitcoin app is installed, allowing them to take
action before funds can be moved.

In practical terms, this means:

- If someone gains access to your wallet (through theft, etc.), the Watchtower notifies you immediately
- When an attacker tries to unfreeze your vault, you receive alerts on all your registered devices as high-priority system notifications
- The RewindBitcoin app immediately displays emergency action options when you tap on the notification
- You then have time to execute a "panic transaction" to move funds to your emergency cold storage before the attacker can access them
- The service works silently in the background, only alerting you when necessary

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### üì± For Users

You can run the Watchtower API directly using npx without installing it:

```bash
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower
```

#### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run with specific port
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --port 3000

# Disable specific networks
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --disable-testnet --disable-tape

# Enable regtest with custom Esplora API URL
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --enable-regtest \
  http://localhost:3002

# Enable commitment verification
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --with-commitments

# Specify custom database folder (default is ./db)
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --db-folder /path/to/database

# Display help information
npx @rewindbitcoin/watchtower --help
```

#### Network Monitoring

If no port is specified, a random available port will be used and displayed in
the console.

By default, the watchtower monitors these networks:

- `bitcoin`
- `testnet`
- [`tape`](https://tape.rewindbitcoin.com/) (Rewind Bitcoin's own test network)

The `regtest` network is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled with
a valid Esplora API URL.

## üîç Blockchain Monitoring Strategy

The Watchtower uses an efficient monitoring strategy to minimize API calls:

1. **On startup:** Initialize with the last checked block height minus
   IRREVERSIBLE_THRESHOLD from the database or current height (minus
   IRREVERSIBLE_THRESHOLD) if starting fresh.

2. **For each monitoring cycle:**

   - Get all new blocks since the last checked height
   - Check if any pending transactions appear in these blocks
   - Send notifications to all devices for found transactions
   - Mark notifications as 'sent' or 'pending'
   - Update the last checked height

3. **Reorg handling:** Recheck the last 4 blocks (IRREVERSIBLE_THRESHOLD) on each
   cycle to handle potential blockchain reorganizations

4. **In-memory caching:** Keep track of checked blocks in memory to avoid
   redundant processing within a session

5. **Commitment verification:** An optional security feature that validates transactions against their original vault creation transaction
   (See the [Commitment Verification](#-commitment-verification) section for complete details)

This approach efficiently monitors transactions while handling multiple devices
per vault and maintaining proper notification state.

## üîê Commitment Verification

The Watchtower API uses a commitment verification system to prevent abuse:

- When enabled with `--with-commitments` flag, each vault registration requires a valid commitment transaction
- The `commitment` is the actual transaction that created the vault on the blockchain
- This transaction should have paid a fee to an authorized service address
- The transactions being monitored by the watchtower are those that spend from this commitment
  (i.e., transactions that initiate the unfreezing of a vault)
- This commitment system serves several important purposes:
  - Prevents spam registrations by requiring a real on-chain payment
  - Ensures only legitimate vaults can be registered with the service
- Each commitment can only be used for one vault ID
- When a trigger transaction is detected, it's verified to be spending from the commitment
- If the trigger is not spending from the commitment, the alert is not sent
- Note: If you're running your own private watchtower, you can disable this feature
  as long as you don't make your service publicly available

---

## üì© Push Notifications

The service uses **Expo Push Notifications** to deliver critical security alerts directly to users' iOS and Android devices when a monitored vault is accessed. These notifications appear as system-level alert dialogs with warning messages, ensuring users are promptly informed of potential security events.

### Critical Security Alerts

When a vault access attempt is detected, the Watchtower immediately sends a push notification to all registered devices associated with that vault. These notifications:

- Appear as high-priority system dialogs on both iOS and Android devices
- Display clear warning messages about the vault being accessed
- Include essential information about which vault is affected
- Provide context about the wallet and transaction

**Example Payload:**

```json
{
  "to": "ExponentPushToken[xyz]",
  "title": "Vault Access Alert!",
  "body": "Your vault vault123 in wallet 'My Bitcoin Wallet' is being accessed!",
  "data": {
    "vaultId": "vault123",
    "walletName": "My Bitcoin Wallet",
    "vaultNumber": 1,
    "txid": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
  }
}
```

### Persistent Notification System

The Watchtower implements a robust retry mechanism to ensure critical security alerts are not missed:

- **Persistent Retries:** The system periodically retries sending notifications until the user explicitly acknowledges receipt
- **Escalating Schedule:**
  - First day: Retry every 6 hours
  - After first day: Retry once per day for up to a week
- **Enhanced Context:** Retry notifications include additional information about when the issue was first detected

This persistent approach ensures that even if a user's device is temporarily offline or notifications are missed, they will still be alerted to potential security issues with their vaults.

**Example Retry Payload:**

```json
{
  "to": "ExponentPushToken[xyz]",
  "title": "Vault Access Alert!",
  "body": "Your vault vault123 in wallet 'My Bitcoin Wallet' is being accessed! (Attempt 3, first detected 14 hours ago)",
  "data": {
    "vaultId": "vault123",
    "walletName": "My Bitcoin Wallet",
    "vaultNumber": 1,
    "txid": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    "attemptCount": 3,
    "firstDetectedAt": 1634567890
  }
}
```

### Acknowledging Notifications

To stop receiving retry notifications once the alert has been seen, the client app should acknowledge receipt using the [Acknowledge Notification Receipt](#acknowledge-notification-receipt) API endpoint:

```bash
POST /watchtower/ack
{
  "pushToken": "ExponentPushToken[xyz]",
  "vaultId": "vault123"
}
```

This acknowledgment system ensures that users are only notified until they've confirmed awareness of the security event.

## üì° API Endpoints

The Watchtower provides a simple REST API for registering vaults and acknowledging notifications. Below are the available endpoints:

### Register Vaults to Be Monitored

**`POST /watchtower/register`** or **`POST /:networkId/watchtower/register`**

- **Purpose:** Registers vaults and associates them with a push notification token.
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `networkId`: The Bitcoin network (`bitcoin`, `testnet`, `tape`, or `regtest`)
  - If using `/watchtower/register` without networkId, defaults to `bitcoin` mainnet
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "pushToken": "ExponentPushToken[xyz]",
    "walletName": "My Bitcoin Wallet",
    "locale": "es", // Optional, defaults to "en"
    "vaults": [
      {
        "vaultId": "vault123",
        "vaultNumber": 1,
        "triggerTxIds": ["txid1", "txid2"],
        "commitment": "0200000001abcdef..." // Required when commitment verification is enabled
      },
      {
        "vaultId": "vault456",
        "vaultNumber": 2,
        "triggerTxIds": ["txid3", "txid4"],
        "commitment": "0200000001ghijkl..." // Required when commitment verification is enabled
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Supported Languages

The Watchtower API currently supports the following languages for notifications:

- English (`en`) - Default
- Spanish (`es`)

The language is specified using the `locale` parameter during vault registration.

- **Responses:**
  - `200 OK`: Registration successful
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data or commitment transaction
  - `403 Forbidden`: Commitment transaction doesn't pay to an authorized address
  - `409 Conflict`: Vault has already been accessed and cannot be registered again

### Health Check

**`GET /generate_204`**

- **Purpose:** Checks if the service is running.
- **Response:** `204 No Content`

### Acknowledge Notification Receipt

**`POST /watchtower/ack`** or **`POST /:networkId/watchtower/ack`**

- **Purpose:** Acknowledges receipt of a notification for a specific vault.
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `networkId`: The Bitcoin network (`bitcoin`, `testnet`, `tape`, or `regtest`)
  - If using `/watchtower/ack` without networkId, defaults to `bitcoin` mainnet
- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "pushToken": "ExponentPushToken[xyz]",
    "vaultId": "vault123"
  }
  ```

- **Responses:**
  - `200 OK`: Acknowledgment successful
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data
  - `404 Not Found`: No matching notification found

| `firstAttemptAt` | INTEGER | Unix timestamp of first notification attempt |
| `acknowledged` | INTEGER | Whether notification was acknowledged (0=no, 1=yes) |
| `lastAttemptAt` | INTEGER | Unix timestamp of last notification attempt |
| `attemptCount` | INTEGER | Number of notification attempts made |
| `locale` | TEXT | User's preferred language (default: 'en') |

**Vault Transactions Table:**
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `txid` | TEXT | Primary Key - Transaction ID to monitor |
| `vaultId` | TEXT | Associated vault ID |
| `status` | TEXT | Status: 'unchecked', 'unseen', 'reversible', 'irreversible' |
| `commitmentTxid` | TEXT | The txid of the commitment transaction (when using commitments) |

**Commitments Table:**
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `txid` | TEXT | Primary Key - Transaction ID of the commitment |
| `vaultId` | TEXT | Associated vault ID |
| `created_at` | INTEGER | Unix timestamp when the commitment was registered |

**Network State Table:**
| Column | Type | Description |
